Given I am on the xyg Page
When I go to xyg aPage
And I select tomorrows date
And I create a new pricing level
And I create the following pricing level:
  | Name  | order | FeeLevelID | FeeBSP           | FromDt | ProductPricingGroupID | FeeDetailType |
  | Jack  | 4     | 0          | 3                |        | 9                     | Percentage    |
  | Mary  | 1     | 0          | 3.679            |        | 9                     | Basis Points  |
  | Louis | 2     | 0          | 54               |        | 9                     | Percentage    |
  | Tom   | 3     | 0          | 08               |        | 9                     | Basis Points  |
  | Katie | 5     | 0          | 2.454358309453   |        | 9                     | Percentage    |
  
 Then I can cancel out of the page  
 Then The new fee Level is saved to the database:
